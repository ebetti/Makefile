## "One to build them all!" :-)

This 'generic' Makefile is meant to build small applications, but also shared
and static libraries.

Following a few rules (listed below) allows you to build your code with
advanced features and almost no configuration.

## Main features

- support for C and C++ code (C++ is partially tested though)
- automatic header files dependency generation
- support for building static or dynamic executables
